# MS-PAINT-REPLICA
This project is an attempt to recreate a simplified version of MS Paint using C++ and Borland's graphic interface. It provides a canvas where users can draw shapes, apply colors, save images, and utilize tools such as a pen and eraser.

#Features
#Supported Shapes
Circle: Draw circles on the canvas.
Rectangle: Create rectangles with customizable dimensions.
Triangle: Draw triangles based on three specified points.
Line: Create straight lines by specifying two points.
Tools
Color Palette: Choose colors for shapes and the canvas background.
Pen: Allows freehand drawing on the canvas.
Eraser: Erase specific parts of the drawing or clear the entire canvas.
Saving Images
Save the created images to your local machine for future reference or sharing.

#Getting Started
#Prerequisites
Borland C++ Compiler (or compatible IDE)
Graphics library for Borland C++

#Installation
Clone the repository.
Open the project in your Borland C++ environment.
Compile and build the project to create the executable.

#Usage
Run the executable to launch the MS Paint replica.
Use the menu or interface to select drawing tools, shapes, colors, etc.
Experiment with different functionalities to create drawings.
Save your artwork using the provided option in the menu.

#Implementation Details
The project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques to organize functionalities into classes such as:

Canvas: Manages the drawing area and background color.
Shape: Base class for different shapes, including Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, and Line.
ColorPalette: Handles color selection for shapes and the canvas.
DrawingTools: Implements tools like the Pen and Eraser for user interaction.
